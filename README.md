# accredible
Overview
--------
The Accredible platform enables organizations to create, manage and distribute digital credentials as digital certificates or open badges.

An example digital certificate and badge can be viewed here: https://www.credential.net/10000005

This gem wraps the Accredible API in Ruby for easy integration into projects. Full API documentation can be found here: http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/ 

Install
--------
Add the following line to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'accredible-api-ruby'
```
and run `bundle install` from your shell.
Then add the following line to an initializer, or appropriate config file.

```ruby
Accredible.api_key = ENV['ACCREDIBLE_API_KEY']
```

Basic Usage
-----------
```ruby
# creating a certificate
recipient = {name: "Jared Smith", email: "example@example.com"}
credential = {name: "#{course.title}",
  group_name: "Example Group",
  description: "A certificate of completion for a cool course"}

Accredible::Credential.create(
    recipient: recipient, 
    credential: credential)
```
